ssh keys to linodes after creation
create workspace folder
- make config file and explain how config files have presidence?
get ips and make hosts file
check connection with `ansible -i hosts all -m ping`
- link this command back to the config file and let people know they could use either methond
- either method meaning using `-i hosts` to find the inventory or defining the inventory in the config file, `ansible.cfg` 
create playbook to create user on all hosts
- fit in updating and upgrading a new hots
create or add to above playbook, securing host by allowing only key based login and removing root login
- passwordless sudo
  - I want create a file and add a line to said file
  - change the permissions of the file to 440
  - why is is better to create the file in sudoers.d/ than making the change using visudo and making changes to the actual sudoers file?

-make sure to remove password logins.

seems kubelet is not starting due to not having the config file created at `/var/lib/kublet/config.yaml`

seems that file gets created after `kubelet init`

kubelet cgroup driver: \"systemd\" is different from docker cgroup driver: \"cgroupfs\""
